    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>RedFlix IPTV</strong> ("the App")
      respects and protects your privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      RedFlix IPTV is a media player application that allows users to play their
      own IPTV (M3U) playlists. The application does not host, provide, or
      distribute any media content.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or process any personal
      data such as name, email address, location, or identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All user data including playlists, favorite channels, and application
      settings are stored <strong>locally on the user’s device only</strong>.
      When the application is deleted or its data is cleared, this information
      is permanently removed.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Media Content and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      RedFlix IPTV functions solely as a video player. The legality and copyright
      status of the content viewed through the application depends entirely on
      the playlists added by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      The developer of the application cannot be held responsible for any content
      provided or streamed by third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Servers and Network Access</h2>
    <p>
      Streams accessed through the application are hosted on third-party servers.
      When connecting to these servers, your IP address may be visible to the
      content provider. This is an inherent characteristic of internet-based
      streaming and is beyond the control of the application.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The application may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Internet access:</strong> Required to load and play streams.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage access:</strong> Used only when necessary to cache playlist data locally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The application is not specifically directed toward children and does not
      knowingly collect any personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact and Support</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, need support, or wish to
      submit a copyright notice, you may contact us at:
